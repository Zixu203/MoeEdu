## Description:
This project aims to investigate the behavioral differences of users on digital learning platforms across different cities, including viewing habits, query frequencies, and performance in quizzes. Additionally, it proposes a method to predict users' cities based on their interaction records, assisting the platform in gaining a more accurate understanding of its users. The project encompasses data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning model training, and analysis.

## Project Structure:

#### Data Cleaning: 
Cleansing and deduplicating the dataset, as well as adding new features.
#### Urban User Behavior Analysis: 
Analyzing behavioral disparities among users from various cities, such as viewing habits and query frequencies.
#### Peak Hour Analysis: 
Investigating user activity during different time periods in different cities.
#### Feature Engineering: 
Extracting and encoding features from the data to prepare for machine learning model training.
#### Machine Learning Model Training: 
Utilizing algorithms like decision tree classifiers to predict users' city affiliations based on their interaction records.
#### Results Presentation: 
Generating decision tree model visualizations, preparing analysis reports, etc.
#### Usage Instructions:
1. Upload the project dataset to the specified location.
2. Run the code to clean and engineer features from the data.
3. Analyze the data to understand the behavioral characteristics of users in different cities.
4. Train machine learning models to predict users' cities.
5. Generate decision tree model visualizations and write analysis reports.

## Requirements:
- Run on google colab
- Relevant Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, pydotplus.
